### Assignment4 : Geometric Shape Modeling
- This is a C++ application that simulates a Slot Machine Game.
- This applicarion is designed to practice fundamental OOP concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- The 'Shape' is the parent class that other kinds of shapes(Rectangle, Rhombus, Triangle...) inherit the key features of Shape class.
- The 'SlotMachine' class uses these different kinds of shape classes to generate 3 random shapes and compensates the player
according to the result of the game.
